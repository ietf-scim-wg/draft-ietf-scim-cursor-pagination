               Cursor-based Pagination of SCIM Resources
                draft-ietf-scim-cursor-pagination-latest

Abstract

   This document defines additional SCIM (System for Cross-Domain
   Identity Management) query parameters and result attributes to allow
   use of cursor-based pagination in SCIM implementations that are
   implemented with existing code bases, databases, or APIs where
   cursor-based pagination is already well established.

1.  Introduction

   The two common patterns for result pagination are index-based
   pagination and cursor-based pagination.  Rather than attempt to
   compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of competing
   pagination patterns, this document simply recognizes that SCIM
   service providers are commonly implemented as an interoperability
   layer on top of already existing application codebases, databases,
   and/or APIs that already have a well established pagination pattern.

   Translating from an underlying cursor-based pagination pattern to the
   index-based pagination defined in Section 3.4.2.4 of [RFC7644]
   ultimately requires the SCIM service provider to fully iterate the
   underlying cursor, store the results, and then serve indexed pages
   from the stored results.  This task of "pagination translation"
   dramatically increases complexity and memory requirements for
   implementing a SCIM Service Provider, and may be an impediment to
   SCIM adoption for some applications and identity systems.

   This document defines a simple addition to the SCIM protocol that
   allows SCIM service providers to reuse underlying cursors without
   expensive translation.  Support for cursor-based pagination in SCIM
   encourages broader cross-application identity management
   interoperability by encouraging SCIM service provider implementations
   for applications and identity systems where cursor-based pagination
   is already well-established.

2.  Query Parameters and Response Attributes

   The following table describes the URL pagination parameters for
   requesting cursor-based pagination:

    +===========+====================================================+
    | Parameter | Description                                        |
    +===========+====================================================+
    | cursor    | The string value of the nextCursor attribute from  |
    |           | a previous result page.  The cursor value MUST be  |
    |           | empty or omitted for the first request of a        |
    |           | cursor-paginated query.  This value may only       |
    |           | contained characters from the unreserved           |
    |           | characters set defined in section 2.2 of [RFC3986] |
    +-----------+----------------------------------------------------+
    | count     | A positive integer.  Specifies the desired maximum |
    |           | number of query results per page, e.g., count=10.  |
    |           | When specified, the service provider MUST NOT      |
    |           | return more results than specified, although it    |
    |           | MAY return fewer results.  If count is not         |
    |           | specified in the query, the maximum number of      |
    |           | results is set by the service provider.            |
    +-----------+----------------------------------------------------+

                        Table 1: Query Parameters

   The following table describes cursor-based pagination attributes
   returned in a paged query response:

    +================+===============================================+
    | Element        | Description                                   |
    +================+===============================================+
    | nextCursor     | A cursor value string that MAY be used in a   |
    |                | subsequent request to obtain the next page of |
    |                | results.  Service providers supporting        |
    |                | cursor-based pagination MUST include          |
    |                | nextCursor in all paged query responses       |
    |                | except when returning the last page.          |
    |                | nextCursor is omitted from a response only to |
    |                | indicate that there are no more result pages. |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | previousCursor | A cursor value string that MAY be used in a   |
    |                | subsequent request to obtain the previous     |
    |                | page of results.  Returning previousCursor is |
    |                | OPTIONAL.                                     |
    +----------------+-----------------------------------------------+

                       Table 2: Response Attributes

   Cursor values are opaque; clients MUST not make assumptions about
   their structure.  When the client wants to retrieve another result
   page for a query, it should query the same Service Provider endpoint
   with all query parameters and values being identical to the initial
   query with the exception of the cursor value which should be set to a
   nextCursor (or previousCursor) value that was returned by Service
   Provider in a previous response.

   For example, to retrieve the first 10 Users with userName starting
   with J, use an empty cursor and set the count to 10:

   GET /Users?filter=userName%20sw%20J&cursor&count=10
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD

   The SCIM provider in response to the query above returns metadata
   regarding pagination similar to the following example (actual
   resources removed for brevity):

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   {
      "totalResults":100,
      "itemsPerPage":10,
      "nextCursor":"VZUTiyhEQJ94IR",
      "schemas":["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
      "Resources":[{
         ...
      }]
   }

   Given the example above, to request the next page or results, use the
   same query parameters and values except set the cursor to the value
   of nextCursor (VZUTiyhEQJ94IR):

   GET /Users?filter=username%20sw%20J&cursor=VZUTiyhEQJ94IR&count=10
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json
   Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   {
      "totalResults": 100,
      "itemsPerPage": 10,
      "previousCursor: "ze7L30kMiiLX6x"
      "nextCursor": "YkU3OF86Pz0rGv",
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
      "Resources":[{
         ...
      }]
   }

   In the example above, the response includes the OPTIONAL
   previousCursor indicating that the Service Provider supports forward
   and reverse traversal of result pages.

   As described in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC7644] Service Providers SHOULD
   return an accurate value for totalResults which is the total number
   of resources for all pages.  Service Providers implementing cursor
   pagination that are unable to estimate totalResults MAY choose to
   omit the totalResults attribute.

2.1.  Pagination errors

   If a Service Provider encounters invalid pagination query parameters
   (invalid cursor value, count value, etc), or other error condition,
   the Service Provider SHOULD return the appropriate HTTP response
   status code and detailed JSON error response as defined in
   Section 3.12 of [RFC7644].  Most pagination error conditions would
   generate an HTTP response with status code 400.  Since many
   pagination error conditions are not user recoverable, error messages
   SHOULD focus on communicating error details to the SCIM client
   developer.

   For HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) responses, the following
   detail error types are defined.  These error types extend the list of
   error types defined in [RFC7644] Section 3.12, Table 9: SCIM Detail
   Error Keyword Values.

   +===============+==================================+===============+
   | scimType      | Description                      | Applicability |
   +===============+==================================+===============+
   | invalidCursor | Cursor value is invalid.  Cursor | GET (Section  |
   |               | value should be empty to request | 3.4.2 of      |
   |               | the first page and set to the    | [RFC7644])    |
   |               | nextCursor or previousCursor     |               |
   |               | value for subsequent queries.    |               |
   +---------------+----------------------------------+---------------+
   | expiredCursor | Cursor has expired.  Do not wait | GET (Section  |
   |               | longer than cursorTimeout (600   | 3.4.2 of      |
   |               | sec) to request additional       | [RFC7644])    |
   |               | pages.                           |               |
   +---------------+----------------------------------+---------------+
   | invalidCount  | Count value is invalid.  Count   | GET (Section  |
   |               | value must be between 1 - and    | 3.4.2 of      |
   |               | maxPageSize (500)                | [RFC7644])    |
   +---------------+----------------------------------+---------------+

                        Table 3: Pagination Errors

2.2.  Sorting

   If sorting is implemented as described Section 3.4.2.3 of [RFC7644],
   then cursor-paged results SHOULD be sorted.

2.3.  Cursors as the Only Pagination Method

   A SCIM Service Provider MAY require cursor-based pagination to
   retrieve all results for a query by including a nextCursor value in
   the response even when the query does not include the cursor
   parameter.

   For example:

   GET /Users
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json

   The SCIM Service Provider may respond to the above query with a page
   containing defaultPageSize results and a nextCursor value as shown in
   the below example (Resources omitted for brevity):

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   {
      "totalResults": 5000,
      "itemsPerPage": 100,
      "nextCursor": "HPq72Pax3JUaNa",
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
      "Resources": [{
         ...
      }]
   }

3.  Querying Resources using HTTP POST

   Section 3.4.2.4 of [RFC7644] defines how clients MAY execute the HTTP
   POST method combined with the /.search path extension to issue
   execute queries without passing parameters on the URL.  When using
   /.search, the client would pass the parameters defined in Section 2

  POST /User/.search
  Host: example.com
  Accept: application/scim+json
  Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD

  {
     "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:SearchRequest"],
     "attributes": ["displayName", "userName"],
     "filter": "displayName sw \"smith\"",
     "cursor": "",
     "count": 10
  }

   Which would return a result containing a nextCursor value which may
   be used by the client in a subsequent call to return the next page of
   resources

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   {
      "totalResults": 100,
      "itemsPerPage": 10,
      "nextCursor": "VZUTiyhEQJ94IR",
      "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"],
      "Resources": [{
         ...
      }]
   }

4.  Service Provider Configuration

   The /ServiceProviderConfig resource defined in Section 4 of [RFC7644]
   facilitates discovery of SCIM service provider features.  A SCIM
   Service provider implementing cursor-based pagination SHOULD include
   the following additional attribute in JSON document returned by the
   /ServiceProviderConfig endpoint:

   pagination  A complex type that indicates pagination configuration
      options.  OPTIONAL.

   cursor  A Boolean value specifying support of cursor-based
      pagination.  REQUIRED.

   index  A Boolean value specifying support of index-based pagination.
      REQUIRED.

   defaultPageSize  Non-negative integer value specifying the default
      number of results returned in a page when a count is not specified
      in the query.  OPTIONAL.

   maxPageSize  Non-negative integer specifying the maximum number of
      results returned in a page regardless of what is specified for the
      count in a query.  The maximum number of results returned may be
      further restricted by other criteria.  OPTIONAL.

   cursorTimeout  Non-negative integer specifying the maximum number
      seconds that a cursor is valid between page requests.  Clients
      waiting too long between cursor pagination requests may receive an
      invalid cursor error response.  No value being specified may mean
      that there is no cursor timeout or that the cursor timeout is not
      a static duration.  OPTIONAL.

   Before using cursor-based pagination, a SCIM client MAY fetch the
   Service Provider Configuration document from the SCIM service
   provider and verify that cursor-based pagination is supported.

   For example:

   GET /ServiceProviderConfig
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/scim+json

   A service provider supporting both cursor-based pagination and index-
   based pagination would return a document similar to the following
   (full ServiceProviderConfig schema defined in Section 5 of [RFC7643]
   has been omitted for brevity):

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/scim+json

   {
      "schemas": [
         "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:ServiceProviderConfig"],
         ...

      "pagination": {
         "cursor": true,
         "index": true
      },

      ...
   }

   Service Provider implementors SHOULD ensure that misuse of pagination
   by a SCIM client does not deplete Service Provider resources or
   prevent valid requests from other clients being handled.  Defenses
   for a SCIM Service Provider are similar those used to protect other
   Web API services -- including the use of a "Web API gateway" layer,
   to provide authentication, rate limiting, IP allow/block lists,
   logging and monitoring, response caching, etc.

   For example, an obvious protection against abuse is for the Service
   Provider to require client authentication in order to retrieve large
   result sets and enforce an overriding totalResults limit for non-
   authenticated clients.  Another example would be for a Service
   Provider that implements cursor pagination to restrict the number of
   cursors that can be allocated by a client or enforce cursor
   lifetimes.

5.  Security Considerations

   This section elaborates on the security considerations associated
   with the implementation of cursor pagination in SCIM.  It is
   imperative that implementers consider the following security aspects
   to safeguard against both deliberate attacks and inadvertent misuse
   that may compromise the system's security posture.

5.1.  Threat Model and Security Environment

   The threat landscape is characterized by two primary types of actors:

   1.  Unauthenticated and Authenticated Malicious Actors: These
       individuals or entities represent a malevolent threat.  Their
       objectives include unauthorized access to data, alteration, or
       deletion through cursor-enabled queries.  They may also seek to
       deplete server resources deliberately, aiming to cause a denial-
       of-service state, thereby reducing service availability.

   2.  Authenticated Benign Users: This category includes legitimate
       users who, due to confusion or a lack of understanding,
       inadvertently engage in actions that consume server resources
       excessively.  Such actions, while not ill-intended, can lead to
       unintended denial of service by overwhelming the system's
       capacity.

5.2.  Confidentiality

   To ensure that confidential data remains appropriately secured:

   *  Implementors MUST ensure that pagination through results sets is
      strictly confined to the data that the actor's current identity
      has been authorized to access.  This holds true even in cases
      where the actor has obtained a cursor pertaining to a result set
      that was generated by a different actor.

   *  Authorization checks MUST BE continuously applied as an actor
      navigates through the result set associated with a cursor.  Under
      no circumstances should possession of a cursor be interpreted as
      granting any supplementary access privileges to the actor.

   *  In alignment with Section 2, cursor values are to be treated as
      opaque entities.  Clients are strictly prohibited from making any
      inferences or assumptions about their internal structure.

   *  The system MUST handle error scenarios gracefully, while not
      exposing sensitive data.  For instance, if an actor attempts to
      access a page of results outside their authorized scope, or if a
      request is made for a non-existent page, the system should respond
      with identical error messages, so as not to disclose any details
      of the underlying data or the nature of the authorization failure.
      It is acceptable, however, for the system to log different
      messages to a log accessible by administrators or other authorized
      personnel.

5.3.  Integrity

   The extension discussed herein is query-only and does not inherently
   pose a substantial risk to data integrity.  However, the focus is
   placed on safeguarding the integrity of the applications and clients
   that depend on this extension, rather than the integrity of the
   Service Provider.  Specific considerations include: It is not
   required to tie a cursor to specific actor.  However, if a cursor is
   tied to an actor and if the actor's permissions change, and the actor
   is still using the cursor, the actor may miss records OR there may be
   unauthorized access to data.

   *  Servers are authorized to invalidate all tokens/watermarks
      corresponding to an actor immediately following a change in
      permissions.  This ensures that any queries executed post-
      permission change, utilizing old tokens/watermarks, will be
      denied.

   *  As an alternative approach, servers may opt to retain the existing
      tokens/watermarks but must ensure that any metadata tied to the
      result set, such as record counts, is updated to reflect the new
      permissions accurately.

5.4.  Availability

   The concern for availability primarily stems from the potential for
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  If the server elects to retain
   substantial data or metadata for each cursor, numerous concurrent
   queries with &cursor could strain and eventually exhaust server
   resources.  This could be orchestrated by an attacker with malicious
   intent or could occur innocuously as a result of actions taken by a
   benign but confused actor.

   To mitigate such risks, the following strategies are recommended:

   *  Implementation of rate limiting to control the volume and cadence
      of cursor requests.  This approach should adhere to established
      standards for rate limiting, details of which can be found in
      [RFC6585].

   *  Cursory mechanisms must be designed in a manner that avoids any
      additional consumption of server resources with the initiation of
      new &cursor requests.

   *  It is advisable to establish a ceiling on the number of cursors
      permissible at any given time.  Alternatively, the adoption of an
      opaque identifier system that conservatively utilizes resources
      may be used.

   *  Token invalidation mechanisms (including mechanisms triggered by
      permissions changes) must be designed to be resource-efficient to
      prevent them from being exploited for DoS attacks.

   *  Actors may face challenges in maintaining a seamless pagination
      experience if their permissions are in a state of flux.  Proactive
      measures should be taken to ensure that permission changes do not
      disrupt the user experience.
