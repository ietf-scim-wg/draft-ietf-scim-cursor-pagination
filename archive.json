          "body": "The question is, in essence, \u201cif I have an active cursor and update the Nth record in the cursor, does the record update? And does the cursor update?\u201d  I think we need two separate answers.  First, we should consider adding guidance such as:\r\n \r\n`Implementors MUST NOT prevent resources from being updated (locking resources) while implementing cursor pagination.`\r\n \r\nHowever, this change may lead to a lack of clarity about the state of the data in the cursor.  One way to address this is to enable options to support a point in time cursor vs. strongly consistent read where updates are included.  For example:\r\n \r\n```\r\n     GET /Users?filter=username%20sw%20J&cursor&count=10&consistentRead\r\n     Host: example.com\r\n     Accept: application/scim+json\r\n     Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD\r\n \r\n     GET /Users?filter=username%20sw%20J&cursor&count=10&pointInTimeRead\r\n     Host: example.com\r\n     Accept: application/scim+json\r\n     Authorization: Bearer U8YJcYYRMjbGeepD\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar changes will need to be enabled for `POST` requests for consistency.  Note that there is no implementation guidance.  How an implementation achieves this is up to the implementer if they choose to implement cursor based pagination.\r\n \r\nIf we go this route, we'll also need to include some additional fields in the service provider configuration.  A first pass at defining these fields is below:\r\n \r\n```\r\n      cursorType A complex type that indicates support for cursor read strategies.  If cursor-based\r\n      paginations are enabled this value is REQUIRED and at least one subvalue MUST be true.\r\n \r\n         consistentRead A Boolean type indicating support for strongly consistent reads. \r\n         The client will always be returned the freshest data. OPTIONAL.\r\n \r\n         pointInTimeRead A Boolean type indicating support for cursors returning data as it existed at\r\n         the time of query execution. Changes to the dataset are not reflected in the cursor. OPTIONAL.\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I agree with what was said during yesterday's WG meeting that defining two options might not be desirable for interoperability reasons.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see one important use case for cusor-based pagination is paging through large amounts of data. In recent discussions one important aspect was that caching large amounts of data may lead to high resource consumption and potentially DoS. For point in time read, it is my understanding that the whole data set would need to be cached. For the other option keeping references to the result set should suffice. This is probably an important disadvantage of point in time, when the goal is paging through a really large data set.\r\n\r\nOn another note it seems that not all systems support strongly consistent read. E.g. [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html) does not support it in all circumstances.\r\n\r\nInstead of having two options here it might make sense to state that the result set will contain \"eventually consistent\" data? This would not impose additional requirements on SCIM server implementations. Of course clients would then need to cope with the situation that results will be partially up to date regarding the point in time when they opened up their cursor. As far as I can see will then affect how clients handle future delta queries.\r\n",

          "body": "Here is a use case that maybe we can react to and then tune/reject:  \r\nScenario:  a SCIM server offers a total set of 5 million user objects and a SCIM client wants to keep those objects synchronized in their own systems.   The SCIM client requests a paginated list of all 5 million objects, and are served 1000 objects at a time.  This means that 5000 separate fetches will be required for the SCIM client to completely synchronize their data set.  Due to performance/throttling reasons, it take 5 hours for all 5000 fetches to complete.  During that 5 hours, objects in the sorting order in which the data is served change:   object 1 is deleted after 10 minutes, object 5 is deleted after 4 hours, object 4500 is deleted after 15 minutes.  a new object is created that would be #4800 for a new query 3 hours after the initial paginated response is created.  Object #300 changes one hour in, and object 2500 changes two hours in.  What does the dataset look like for an index-paginated result set, a strongly consistent result set and an eventually consistent result set?    Assuming I've picked the right times and object numbers, I think we should be able to see the differences in what state the client will be in at the end of processing the entire result set.  None of the result sets at the client will exactly mirror the state at the scim server, but hopefully there is a simple way to summarize what developers can know they have at the end.  Let me know if that kind of approach makes sense.  ",
